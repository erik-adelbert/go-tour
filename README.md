My Tour of Go

A Tour of Go is an introduction to the Go programming language.

The easiest way to install the tour locally is to install
[a binary release of Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and then run:

	$ go tool tour

To install the tour from source, first 
[set up a workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and then run:

	$ go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour

This will place a `gotour` binary in your workspace's `bin` directory.

This directory contains the solutions to the exercises presented in the Go tour.

IMPORTANT: The main point of the Go tour is to challenge you, so please try to
solve all problems by yourself before reading these solutions!!!

In any case, these are not the only valid solutions.
